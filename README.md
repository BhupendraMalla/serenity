- Mood logging and history
- Simple journal entry editor
- Auth screens and onboarding flow
- Cross-platform support (mobile, web, desktop)

> Note: This README was generated from the repository structure. Please update the feature list if something is missing or renamed.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (stable recommended). Install instructions: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
- Dart (installed with Flutter)
- Android Studio or Xcode for mobile device/emulator workflows (optional for web/desktop builds)
- (Optional) Git and GitHub account for source control and publishing

## Quick start (development)

1. Clone the repository (or if you already have it locally, open the `serenity` folder):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd "c:\Users\Bhupendra\Desktop\Flutter proejct\serenity"
```

2. Get dependencies:

```powershell
flutter pub get
```

3. Run on a connected device or emulator:

```powershell
# list devices
flutter devices

# run on the default device
flutter run

# or run on Windows desktop (if enabled)
flutter run -d windows
```

4. Build release artifacts:

```powershell
# Android APK
flutter build apk --release

# iOS (on macOS)
flutter build ios --release

# Web
flutter build web
```

## Tests

Run unit/widget tests:

```powershell
flutter test
```

## Project structure (high level)

- `lib/` — application code and UI
	- `src/screens/` — screens grouped by feature (auth, home, mood, onboarding, etc.)
	- `src/services/` — repositories and service classes (hive, repositories)
	- `src/models/` — data models used by the app
	- `src/providers/` — state providers
- `assets/` — icons, images, audio
- `android/`, `ios/`, `macos/`, `windows/`, `linux/` — platform projects
- `test/` — unit and widget tests

Open `lib/main.dart` to locate the app entry point.

## Important notes & secrets

- The repo includes mobile platform folders and generated files. Large binaries or signing keys should not be committed.
- `android/key.properties` and signing JKS files are ignored by the provided `.gitignore`. If you have local keystores or API keys, keep them out of source control.

## Contributing

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
- Run and add tests for new functionality when appropriate
- Open a pull request with a clear description of changes

## Troubleshooting

- If you see missing plugin or generated file errors, run:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

- For platform-specific build failures, inspect the platform folder (`android/`, `ios/`) and run the build command for that platform locally.

## License

This project does not include a license file. Add a `LICENSE` if you want to make the project's licensing explicit.

If you'd like, I can also:

- add a `LICENSE` file (MIT/Apache/etc.)
- create a short screenshot/assets section with example images
- add a GitHub Actions workflow for CI (tests + flutter analyze)

Tell me which extras you want and I will add them.
